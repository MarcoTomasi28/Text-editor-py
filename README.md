# Text-editor-py
 
Created by Marco Tomasi

This is a text editor (like Notepad on windows) written in python. I made this program to solve 
some shortcomings of the Notepad program, some of the added features are:

- A primordial form of graphic customization (work in progress)
- A text-to-speach system (work in progress)
- A formatting system for excel formulas (very useful for those who find themselves with very 
long excel formulas and want to make them easier to read)

I'm still working on those features and some others for example a find function and more 
graphic customization.

I apologize for any grammatical errors I have made in this text as English is not my first language.
